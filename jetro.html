    <h2>My Baby</h2>
    <p>Happy Valentine's Day to the most amazing and beautiful woman in my life. I cannot express how grateful i am to have you. You are the one who understands me like no one else. You remind me of home, all of the simple things in life, of light and love and the reason i am not alone. I will be forever grateful everyday that i have you in my life because so much things could have kept us from meeting each other, from being together, or just from being alive at this exact moment in time. So many things could have happen to keep us from existing together, in the bodies we are now in. And i will be forever be grateful that somehow, in this infinite universe we found each other and i will be forever grateful for that. Thank you so much for everything, baby. I promise that i will forever cherish and love you 'til my last breath. I love you so much baby!</p>
